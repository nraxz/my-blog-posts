I'm Naresh Shahi, calling the bustling city of London my home for years. With a robust background in computer science, I've been navigating the intricate world of software development for over 15 years. In my linguistic toolkit, you'll find fluency in Nepali, English, and Hindi (Urdu), along with a knack for basic communication in Thai.

Beyond the screen and code, I find solace in the great outdoors, especially through the exhilarating activity of hiking. It's not just a physical challenge; it's my way of connecting with nature, seeking a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.

Music is my constant companion, and my playlist is as diverse as my professional endeavours. While I respect everyone's musical tastes, my go-to choices often gravitate towards classic and modern classics, creating a melodic backdrop to both work and leisure.

When it comes to visual delights, I value the freedom to immerse myself fully. Movies and TV shows are best enjoyed in solitude, allowing me to take breaks and rewind scenes at my own pace. Lately, I've found a fascination for BBC's crime investigation and police TV shows, captivated by their intricate narratives and compelling characters.

Beyond the everyday, my interests sprawl into fascinating territories. While I wouldn't call myself an expert, concepts like infinity, nothingness, God, numbers, the universe, evolution theory, and quantum theory really captivate me. I love delving into discussions about these topics, absorbing different perspectives from people who bring diverse insights, even if it's just to satisfy my curiosity. Life, to me, is a mosaic of technology, nature, and the arts, woven together by my diverse interests and cultural background.
