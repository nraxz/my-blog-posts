I'm Naresh Shahi, and I've lived in London for many years. I've been navigating the complex world of software development for almost 15 years, thanks to a solid education in computer science.

My language arsenal includes competence in Nepali, English, and Hindi (Urdu), as well as a penchant for basic Thai conversation.

Beyond the computer and code, I find refuge in nature, particularly through the invigorating action of hiking. It's more than simply a physical challenge; it's my way of reconnecting with nature and seeking a peaceful respite from the rush and bustle of city life.

While I respect everyone's musical preferences, my go-to selections frequently lean towards classic and modern classics, providing a melodic backdrop to both work and play.

When it comes to visual delights, I love the ability to totally immerse myself. Movies and TV shows are best appreciated alone, as this allows me to take breaks and rewind scenes at my leisure. I've recently developed an interest in BBC crime investigation and police TV dramas, drawn in by their intricate tales and interesting characters.

My interests go well beyond the typical into fascinating fields. Though I'm not an expert in any of these fields, concepts like infinity, nothingness, God, numbers, the universe, evolution theory, and quantum theory all intrigue me. I like engaging in these kinds of talks and learning from others who have different perspectives, even if it's just to satisfy my curiosity. In addition, I like to explore cultural heritage and combine technology, the environment, and the arts to create a mosaic that represents life.
